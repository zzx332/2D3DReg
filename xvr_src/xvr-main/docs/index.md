# X-ray to Volume Registration

***Training patient-specific 2D/3D registration models in 5 minutes***

- :rocket: A single CLI/API for training models and registering clinical data
- :zap: 100x faster patient-specific model training than [`DiffPose`](https://github.com/eigenvivek/DiffPose)
- :triangular_ruler: Submillimeter registration accuracy with new image similarity metrics
- :compass: Human-interpretable pose parameters for training your own models
- :snake: Pure Python/PyTorch implementation
- :computer: Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows
